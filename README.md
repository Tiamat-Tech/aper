Aper is a Rust library for data synchronization using **state machines**. Aper provides mechanisms to represent common data structures in terms of state machines, as well as a transport-agnostic protocol for keeping multiple instances of a state machine synchronized across a network.

Use-cases include real-time multiplayer applications that operate on shared state, client-server applications that want to share state updates incrementally and bidirectionally, and multiplayer turn-based games.

## What is a state machine?

For the purposes of Aper, a state machine is simply a `struct` or `enum` that
implements `StateMachine` and has the following properties:
- It defines a `StateMachine::Transition` type, through which every
  possible change to the state can be described. It is usually useful,
  though not required, that this be an `enum` type.
- It defines a `StateMachine::Conflict` type, which describes a conflict which
  may occur when a transition is applied that is not valid at the time it is
  applied. For simple types where a conflict is impossible, you can use
  `NeverConflict` for this.
- All state updates are deterministic: if you clone a `StateMachine` and a
  `Transition`, the result of applying the cloned transition to the cloned
  state must be identical to applying the original transition to the original
  state.

Here's an example `StateMachine` implementing a counter:

```rust
use aper::{StateMachine, NeverConflict};
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, Default)]
struct Counter { value: i64 }

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
enum CounterTransition {
    Reset,
    Increment(i64),
    Decrement(i64),
}

impl StateMachine for Counter {
    type Transition = CounterTransition;
    type Conflict = NeverConflict;

    fn apply(&self, event: &CounterTransition) -> Result<Counter, NeverConflict> {
        match event {
            CounterTransition::Reset => Ok(Counter {value: 0}),
            CounterTransition::Increment(amount) => Ok(Counter {value: self.value + amount}),
            CounterTransition::Decrement(amount) => Ok(Counter {value: self.value - amount}),
        }
    }
}
```

## Why not CRDT?
[Conflict-free replicated data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)
are a really neat way of representing data that's shared between peers.
In order to avoid the need for a central “source of truth”, CRDTs require
that update operations (i.e. state transitions) be [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property).
This allows them to represent a bunch of common data structures, but doesn't
allow you to represent arbitrarily complex update logic.
By relying on a central authority, a state-machine approach allows you to
implement data structures with arbitrary update logic, such as atomic moves
of a value between two data structures, or the rules of a board game.
